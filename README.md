# Deer
Output beeps and random heights for null.

Deer is wip plug-in for Grasshopper 3D, each branches are for 1 single GHPython component in Grasshopper 3D.
Copy and paste the .py code and create the set inputs/outputs for each component.

For this plug-in, you'll need the latest Rhinoceros 7 (prefer in Mac).
